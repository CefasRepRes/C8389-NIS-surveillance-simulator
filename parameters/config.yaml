## SIMULATION PARAMETERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# number of years that sites are visited
num_years: 11

# number of sites to survey
num_sites: 100

# define distributions to use for introduction and establishment probabilities
# establishment is either: (1) 'random uniform' OR (2) 'equal uniform' (case insensitive)
# introduction is either: (1) 'random uniform' OR (2) 'positive normal' (case insensitive)
establish_risk: "equal uniform"
intro_risk: "positive normal"  # if normal majority of sites are intermediate risk

# probability of establishment, required if 'equal uniform' establish_risk
establish_prob: 0.8

# frequency of site visits (e.g. 0.5 = once every 2 years)
mean_visit_rate: 1

# detection dynamic
# if "constant" the probabilty detection remains the same with time
# if "increasing" the probability of detection increases with time and can mimic spread/expansion
# if "decreasing" the probability of detection decreases with time and may mimic die out
detect_dynamic: "constant"

# mean, minimum and maximum detection probability
det_prob: 0.8
det_prob_min: 0
det_prob_max: 1

# logical stating whether sensitvity analysis and report should be generated
sensitivity_analysis: TRUE

# logical stating whether elasticity analysis and report should be generated

# percentage of change to test each parameters
